        My name is Geoff Brown.  I'm 32 years old and a married father of 2 boys.
        I recently quit my job at a manufacturing company to find something different/better.
        Since there is such a high demand for web developers, it seemed like a good direction to take.
        I feel that my many years in management as a project manager will help to fuel my new career choice.
        I hope that you can see my potential and will take a chance on me.

            Thanks for your time.
